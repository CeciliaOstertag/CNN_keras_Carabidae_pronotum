# CNN_keras_Carabidae_pronotum

Our dataset is composed of 293 RGB images of carabidaeâ€™s pronotums. 
For each image, 8 landmarks were manually placed, and their coordinates are noted in a separate file (with the y axis inverted).
We aim to use a deep learning approach to locate automatically the landmarks in the images. To do this, we began by a simple classification task, to see if our landmarks could be easily separated into 8 different classes by a neural network.
